# Student Attendance System

A simple, web-based student attendance management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to add students, mark their attendance (present/absent), and view historical records. Data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage for persistence.

## Features

- ✅ **Add Students**: Easily add new students to the system.
- ✅ **Mark Attendance**: Mark each student as present or absent for a session.
- ✅ **Attendance Records**: View past attendance sessions with timestamps.
- ✅ **Persistent Storage**: Uses localStorage to save data across browser sessions.
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices.
- ✅ **Reset Functionality**: Start a new session or clear all records.
